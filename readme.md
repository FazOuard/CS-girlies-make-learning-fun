Hello Welcome to the cs girlies repo hackathon
Let's start by the frontend and what i made it work first.
I'm using React js using vite and tailwind css 
Reactjs:
 npm create vite@latest frontend
 then you choose react then javascript then just agree whith whatever is next and name your folder, i named it "frontend" .
so there are some essentials packages:
for app.jsx: npm install react-router-dom
npm install lucide-react
npm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/engine @tsparticles/slim

Tailwind.css:
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

And I get them installed  but it's not all, I have to create two js files, one for postcss and one for tailwindcss, and then implement tailwind in index.css... and then it might work!
