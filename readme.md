Hello Welcome to the cs girlies repo hackathon <br />
Let's start by the frontend and what i made it work first. <br />
I'm using React js using vite and tailwind css <br />
Reactjs:<br />
 npm create vite@latest frontend<br />
 then you choose react then javascript then just agree whith whatever is next and name your folder, i named it "frontend" .<br />
so there are some essentials packages:<br />
for app.jsx: npm install react-router-dom<br />
npm install lucide-react<br />
npm install @tsparticles/react @tsparticles/engine @tsparticles/slim<br />

Tailwind.css:<br />
npm install -D @tailwindcss/postcss<br />
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer<br />

And I get them installed  but it's not all, I have to create two js files, one for postcss and one for tailwindcss, and then implement tailwind in index.css... and then it might work!<br />
